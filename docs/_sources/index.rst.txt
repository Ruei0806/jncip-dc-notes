JNCIP-DC Study Notes
====================

Welcome to `Tyler Christiansen <https://twitter.com/supertylerc>`_'s
notes for the
`JNCIP-DC <https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/data-center-track?tab=jncip-dc>`_
exam.  These notes are open source.  I would love to see additional
collaboration and contribution from others who are either pursuing the
exam or who are far more knowledgeable than myself.  If you're
interested in contributing, please see the :ref:`contributing` section
below.

These notes have been taken and organized in the order of the listed
`JNCIP-DC <https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/data-center-track?tab=jncip-dc>`_
exam objectives.  The primary reference has been the
`QFX5100 Series <https://www.amazon.com/Juniper-QFX5100-Comprehensive-Building-Next-Generation/dp/1491949570/>`_
book, but other references such as the
`MX Series <https://www.amazon.com/Juniper-MX-Comprehensive-Guide-Technologies/dp/1491932724/>`_
book and official Juniper documentation have been used.  I've tried to
remember to credit any sources I've had while taking notes, but I'm sure
I've left sources off.  If you're aware of a particular source for
something, please let me know so that I can attribute credit.

Contributing
------------

I'll take contributions however I can get them, but here are a few areas
in which I'm particularly interested:

* Diagrams: I'm really terrible at making diagrams.  I actually tried to
  to make a few for this project, but I became far too frustrated with
  the tools available to me (I don't have Visio).  If you can contribute
  diagrams, it would be incredibly helpful.
* Technical Corrections: These are my notes for an exam; I'm not an
  authority on the technologies, and I could definitely be wrong.  I
  don't have a technical reviewer.  If you find technical errors, please
  let me know either via e-mail, a GitHub issue, or a pull request to
  correct the issue.  All I ask is that for any technical correction, a
  source to the correct information be provided.
* Grammatical Correction: This may seem odd, but if there's a grammar
  issue, I'd appreciate a correction.
* Labs and Configurations: More labs and configuration examples are
  always better!  I'm trying to provide examples, but it's sometimes
  difficult to capture.  In some cases, I can't provide any labs or
  configuration snippets because it requires physical gear (such as
  Virtual Chassis) and I only have access to vQFX10k. So if you can
  contribute labs or configuration snippets, they would be greatly
  appreciated!

If you have any other contribution to make, it's 100% welcome.  The best
place to contribute and collaborate is the
`GitHub repository <http://github.com/supertylerc/jncip-dc-notes/>`_.
Issues can be reported, and if you're familiar with GitHub and/or
ReStructured Text (the markup language in which these notes are
written), you can submit pull requests to contribute.

All contributions will be added to the :ref:`contributors` page unless
the contributor requests otherwise.
