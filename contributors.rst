Contributors
============

This page lists any contributors to these notes, whether they are issues
reported, pull requests submitted, or suggestions made.  The following
format is used:

* <Name> (@<twitter_handle>): <contribution_message>
  (link to GitHub issue(s) and/or pull request(s))

All of this is optional.  Anything that is either not relevant or
requested to be left out will not be present in the entry.
